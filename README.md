# Morrowind-Mods
This is a collection of my Morrowind mods.
You can find more info about them in the README within their respective folder.

I do not give permission to repost these mods elsewhere, as I do not like the idea of them ending up on sites that force you to create an account in order to download them. Keeping them here lets anyone download them.

These mods were all made and tested with OpenMW.
They may run in Vanilla Morrowind, but it is untested and I will not support it if you run into issues.
