# Melanat - v1.0
This mod adds a small cavern in cell (17,9) named Melanat, after the island of King's Field II.
Within it, you'll find two of the game's iconic weapons; Moonlight and Dark Slayer.

I did my best at keeping them powerful but not overly so.
Initially I tried comparing KF's Iron Shortsword with these weapons and trying to cross-reference that with Morrowind to create 'correct' stats.
But that ended up making swords twice as strong as they are now, so I took some liberties and tried to keep them fair.

I also gave them unique enchantments similar to their Sword Magic within King's Field II.
Dark Slayer however does not constantly regenerate your Magicka pool like it does in KF, instead it regenerates your Magicka at 1pt/s for 60s after casting its spell.

These mods were all made and tested with OpenMW.
They may run in Vanilla Morrowind, but it is untested and I will not support it if you run into issues.
